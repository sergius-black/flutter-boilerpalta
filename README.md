# boilerpalta

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting boilerplate based on the official project skeleton from flutter 2.5. Its been upgraded to
include more advanced state management using Flutter Bloc, dependency injection and Freezed union clases, as well as using 
a clean architecture folder structure and auto_router for..... stuff.

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.

To support additional languages, please visit the tutorial on
[Internationalizing Flutter
apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
